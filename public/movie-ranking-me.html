<h1>Farid Beck's Best Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>A Bridge Too Far</h3>
<p>This is my all-time memorable movie because it is the first movie I watched when I was still a kid in Primary 3. My uncle was the one who brought me to watch this movie.</p>
<h3>Qurbani</h3>
<p>This was the first ever Hindi movie I watch which started my journey in Hindi films and songs. My friends in Junior college who were mostly Indians recommended me and from then on I was addicted to Hindi films and songs.</p>
<h3>Killing Fields</h3>
<p>This was the first movie I watched after I received the news that I am not required to perform National Service.</p>
<p>As all my college friends had been already enlisted to NS, I was feeling rather alone and dejected. So I decided to cheer myself up and I went to watch this movie all alone.</p>
